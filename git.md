NLP Virtual Lab
Overview
The NLP Virtual Lab is an interactive web-based educational platform designed to teach Natural Language Processing concepts through hands-on experiments and visualizations. Built with Flask and SQLAlchemy, it provides a comprehensive learning environment with modules covering various NLP techniques, real-time text processing, interactive quizzes, and visual demonstrations.

User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

System Architecture
Backend Architecture
Framework: Flask web framework with Python
Database: SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite as the default database (configurable via environment variables)
Session Management: Flask sessions with configurable secret key
Proxy Support: ProxyFix middleware for deployment behind reverse proxies
Frontend Architecture
Template Engine: Jinja2 templates with Bootstrap 5 for responsive UI
CSS Framework: Bootstrap with custom dark theme
JavaScript Libraries:
Feather Icons for iconography
Chart.js for data visualization
D3.js for advanced visualizations (syntax trees, network graphs)
Interactive Components: Real-time text processing with AJAX calls
NLP Processing Engine
Core Library: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
Capabilities: Tokenization, POS tagging, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, stemming, lemmatization
Auto-setup: Automatic download of required NLTK data packages
Key Components
Database Models
User Model: User authentication and management with Flask-Login integration
UserProgress Model: Tracks user completion status, scores, and attempts for each module
QuizQuestion Model: Stores quiz questions with multiple choice options and explanations
Lab Modules
Eight core NLP modules are implemented:

Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal
Part-of-Speech Tagging: Grammatical categorization of words
N-Gram Modeling: Word sequence analysis and context understanding
Named Entity Recognition: Extraction of entities (names, places, organizations)
Sentiment Analysis: Emotional tone detection
Text Classification: Categorization into predefined classes
Word Embeddings: Numerical text representation
Chunking & Parsing: Phrase grouping and grammatical structure analysis
Interactive Features
Real-time Processing: Immediate feedback on text input with visual results
Progress Tracking: User progress persistence across sessions
Quiz System: Module-specific assessments with scoring
Visualization Engine: Advanced charts and tree structures for concept illustration
Data Flow
User Input: Text entered through web interface
Processing: Flask routes handle requests and delegate to NLP processor
Analysis: NLTK performs the requested NLP operations
Visualization: Results are formatted and visualized using Chart.js/D3.js
Storage: User progress and quiz results are persisted to database
Response: JSON responses sent back to frontend for display

Deployment Strategy
Development Environment
Local Development: Flask development server with debug mode
Database: SQLite for simplicity and portability
Configuration: Environment variables for sensitive data (DATABASE_URL, SESSION_SECRET)
Production Considerations
WSGI Server: Configured with ProxyFix for reverse proxy deployment
Database Scaling: Supports PostgreSQL via environment variable configuration
Connection Pooling: SQLAlchemy engine options for production reliability
Session Security: Configurable secret key for production deployment
Environment Configuration
DATABASE_URL: Configurable database connection string
SESSION_SECRET: Secure session encryption key
Host/Port: Configurable for different deployment environments
The architecture emphasizes modularity, scalability, and educational effectiveness while maintaining simplicity for easy deployment and maintenance.
